## Overview
Realsee Galois New User Guide is a conversion-oriented onboarding page for first-time LiDAR capture users. The interface combines instructional clarity with product confidence: light neutral canvas, dense modular cards, and controlled blue emphasis for guidance, navigation, and action.

The visual tone is professional and operational, not marketing-heavy. Information is grouped into sequential workflow blocks, practical resources, and troubleshooting support so users can move from installation to final deliverables without ambiguity.

## Design Intent
The page should feel like a field operations manual rendered as a modern web product.

- Prioritize scanability over decorative complexity.
- Keep hierarchy explicit: hero, process, standards, resources, outputs, troubleshooting.
- Use blue as the dominant instructional signal color.
- Reserve dark high-contrast panels for “outcome/value” blocks (deliverables, support).

## Foundations

### Color System
The palette is cool, technical, and trust-oriented.

- Light background and white cards establish reading comfort.
- Blue family (`#2563eb`, `#1d4ed8`, `#eaf2ff`) drives action and orientation.
- Green family (`#16a34a`, `#e9f8ef`) communicates checklist correctness.
- Dark gradients (`#172033` → `#0f172a` → `#111827`) emphasize final outputs.

### Typography
Roboto is used as a single-family system for consistency across instructional and product UI contexts.

- Heavy weights (800/900) are used for section titles and CTA emphasis.
- Body copy maintains generous line height for long-form operational guidance.
- Small labels remain compact but bold for quick category parsing.

### Shape and Elevation
Rounded geometry and soft shadows create approachable but structured information blocks.

- Card radii: 20-24px.
- Panel radius: 28px.
- Shadows are soft and broad to separate zones without harsh contrast.

## Layout and Responsiveness

### Desktop (`>= 990px`)
- Hero: two-column composition with visual background support.
- Journey: `4 + 3` step topology with animated dashed path.
- Resource cards: 4-column grids.
- Deliverable chips: 3-column grid.

### Tablet (`700px - 989px`)
- Resource and content grids collapse to 2 columns.
- Priority cards can span full width.

### Mobile (`<= 699px`)
- Single-column flow.
- CTA buttons become full width.
- VR showcase shifts to portrait ratio (`9:16`) for device ergonomics.

## Components

### Hero
- Eyebrow + headline + instructional paragraph + dual CTA.
- Must immediately answer: what this page is, who it is for, what to do first.

### Journey Step Cards
- Numbered sequence badges (`01`-`07`) with icon-coded labels.
- Hover lift interaction supports affordance without distracting from reading.
- Animated path indicates end-to-end workflow continuity.

### Checklist Cards
- Green check icon + concise operational rules.
- Used for “in-field execution” standards (distance, route, positioning).

### Resource Cards
- Structure: icon, micro-label, title, concise description, directional CTA.
- Grouped by task family: Capture, Console/Edit, Downloads.

### Deliverables Panel
- Dark emphasis section for value realization.
- Clickable chips switch or open output examples.
- Embedded VR preview supports immediate trust-building.

### FAQ Accordion
- `details/summary` pattern with explicit `+ / -` state symbol.
- Each item includes diagnosis, action path, and deep-link to full guide.

### Support CTA
- Final escalation zone with high contrast and clear support actions.
- Secondary action uses white-background inversion for contrast balance.

## Interaction and Motion
- Journey path animation: continuous dashed flow (`18s linear infinite`).
- Card hover: subtle `translateY` lift for discoverability.
- Resource CTA hover: slight `translateX` to reinforce “go deeper”.
- Keep all motion short, meaningful, and operationally calm.

## Content Model (DesignMD-friendly)
- Hero value proposition
- Process map (7-step)
- Standards and checks
- Actionable resource matrix
- Deliverable proof block
- Troubleshooting knowledge base
- Support conversion block

## Implementation Guidance
- Convert `--guide-*` variables into your global token layer first.
- Implement components in this order: `hero -> journey -> resource-card -> faq -> deliverables-panel`.
- Keep content externalized (CMS/JSON) so links and FAQ can evolve without style drift.

## Do / Don't
- Do preserve the blue-led instructional hierarchy.
- Do keep heavy typography only for headings and CTA anchors.
- Do maintain large radii and soft shadows for modular clarity.
- Don't replace operational cards with generic marketing banners.
- Don't introduce multiple accent families that weaken process signaling.
- Don't over-animate; this page is a workflow guide, not a showcase microsite.
